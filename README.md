# krist-the-game
this is a repository for a game. It is an advanced rpg type of game with retro type visuals and various genres of music. It has never seen before combat types as well as revolutionary building and other amusing game additions. The game is massive, not only in the physical size but also in the amount of choices and races that the player can partake in. Our team is pouring blood, sweet and 8 bit tears into making this game shine.
